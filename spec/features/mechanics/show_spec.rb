  # Story 2 - Mechanic Show Page

  # As a user,
  # When I visit a mechanic show page
  # I see their name, years of experience, and the names of rides theyâ€™re working on
  # And I only see rides that are open
  # And the rides are listed by thrill rating in descending order (most thrills first)
